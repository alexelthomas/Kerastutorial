Your network will only function or at least function well, on images that are preprocessed in a similar fashion to what it's been trained on. It's therefore useful to establish a format specific for your network. These include, rescaling the pixel values to be between 0 and 255 (png standard), binning or interpolating the image to a specific shape. \n",
